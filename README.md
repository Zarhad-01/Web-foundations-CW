# Web Foundations Coursework Documentation

## Overview
This Web Foundations Coursework project marks my inaugural journey into web development, showcasing the creation of my first-ever website. It features a multi-page site with a homepage, discovery log, and literature review, all meticulously styled with CSS to demonstrate the foundational skills I've begun to develop in HTML and CSS. The project includes a multi-page website with a homepage (`index.html`), a discovery log (`discovery.html`), and a literature review (`litreview.html`), all styled using CSS files (`layout.css`, `litrev.css`, `general.css`).

## Key Features
