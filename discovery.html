            <h2>Week 1 - Welcome to WebF1</h2>
            <p>
                First entry on my discovery log. This is to record what I learn (and how to fix any problems I encounter) every week of doing WebF1. This week we learnt to run and setup the VM, which will be used to host our websites. We briefly looked at the commands we would be using to host our website.
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Use WinSCP to upload the website (ensure homepage is called index.html).</li>
                <li>Go to port.ac.uk/myvm and run the vm. and launch a connection using the Chrome Secure Shell plugin.</li>
                <li>Move into directory using the “cd Website_File” command.</li>
                <li>Host the website using the “http-server” command.</li>
                <li>Ensure you are at the uni or using the vpn.</li>
                <li>Put the IP address of the VM into your URL and the website should be there.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Week 2 - Web Security</h2>
            <p>
                This week we learnt about the differences between secret, sensitive and public information. Secret information is a type that shouldn't be able to be accessed by anyone. Sensitive information should only be able to be accessed only when required by authorisation of the user. Public information is something that the user has deemed acceptable to be viewed by anyone. We discussed the issue surrounding social media users sharing sensitive information that could be used to build a profile on them and then eventually hacked.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our lecture this week was about information and social engineering and was led by Nick savage. He talked about how small amounts of personal information could be used against the user. We watched a video of a woman extracting information from a telephone company about the interviewer using various social engineering techniques.

            <h2>Week 3 - Reviewing Literature</h2>
            <p>
                This week we were introduced to the Literature review where the topic is “Mitigating personal information exposure to the web.” Went through how to do a literature review, which I didn’t know. The basic gist of it is that you cannot provide your own opinions, everything you state must be academically cited. I decided that my topics will be Social Media and the Cloud and I have also started my structured notes on each of my sources.

            <h2>Week 4 - Academic Writing</h2>
            <p>
                This week we were thought about what kind of language we should be using within out literature review. For example we must use formal language, no using Phrasal verbs and things like we aren't allowed to be subjective, hence no I, we, you.

            <p>
                This week we were introduced to Cascading Style Sheets and the various ways we can impliment it. Embedded, which is actually written into the html file using the style tag at the beggining of the code. Linked, which is a seperate file which is then linked to the html file.

            <h2>Week 7 - Separating Form and Content</h2>
            <p>
                This week we were introduced to Cascading Style Sheets and the various ways we can implement it. Embedded, which is actually written into the html file using the style tag at the beginning of the code. Linked, which is a seperate file which is then linked to the html file. We have been told that a linked (external) style sheet will be used for the coursework. We started off by creating a Title, heading and a paragraph. Within each one of these we experimented with element, class and ID selectors, changing the background colours After creating this index page, we uploaded, hosted and ran our websites.

            <p>
                This week we were introduced to the more intricate details of Atom.IO, thich is the program we are using to create our websites. We were shown how to can pick out own themes, and packages and were told to install atom-html-preview, which is an package that allows you to view your html, it was also recommended to add other packages such as highlight-selected, jumpy and a few more. We also got set a task to create a simple version of our discovery log, in html for preparation for the next week.

            <h2>Week 9 - Design</h2>
            <p>
                This week we were given cards with a variety of activities on and were told to sort them into whatever categories we think is appropriate. We then uploaded an image of how we sorted it onto moodle, where we could see what other groups came up with. The purpose of this was to see how we could sort things on our future websites to make them more user friendly.

            <p>
                In the lecture, we were shows how we can put images into our websites and how we can change/ manipulate them in order to fit our design. From this, in the lecture we were given time to play around with images and see what we can do with them and ask any questions if need be.

            <h2>Week 13 - Addressing the Web</h2>
            <p>
                This week we were shown how hyperlinks work, although I had previously been playing with this around week 8, it was good to be able to ask any questions I had and sand down the edges of any questions I had. The hyperlink uses the element “a” and will have a href=”hyperlink here” to show where you are going.

            <p>
                This week we were introduced to the W3 html validator that we have to put onto our website. In the workshop we played around with this. I made mistakes in purpose in order to see how it would show the errors and then went on to working on my website once i felt i had familiarized myself with the validator.

            <h2>Week 15 - Standards</h2>
            <p>
                This week we were discussing the different standardisation bodies and how now having standardisation can cause issues and examples of when this has occurred. One example of this were how the west and east of the USA used different width rail tracks for trains. This meant that trains from the west couldn’t go east and if people or cargo wanted to it would have had to stop and be loaded onto different trains.

            <h2>Week 16 - Usability</h2>
            <p>
                This week we discussed the topic of useability and the factors attributed to this, examples of this are:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Target audience of the website.</li>
                <li>The reason they are visiting your website.</li>
                <li>What pages will be the most used.</li>
                <li>How simple the user interface be.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The user interface is one of the more important features because it essentially the face of your website, and who doesn’t love a good looking face, eh?
