                <h1 id="toppg">Mitigating Personal Information Exposure on the Web</h1>

                <h2 class="sub-heading">Introduction</h2>
                <p>The aim of this literature review is to examine the various techniques to mitigate personal information exposure on the web. The Office of National Statistics (ONS, 2018) shows us that since April 2014, a rise in fraud can be observed that is still ongoing; in September 2016 - 2017 there have been 272,980 offences, it is the highest the stats have been since records began. ONS (2018) also informs us that currently, 90% of adults in the UK have used the internet in 2018; meaning these are all people who could be potential victims of fraud. With these two factors in mind, it is important to know how your personal information may get into others possession and how you can mitigate the exposure of your personal information, the most important of which is being aware of the risks and consequences.</p>
                <h2 class="sub-heading">Social Media</h2>
                <p>With attributes such as date of birth, gender, and zip code, you could individually identify 87% of the US population, and even if you replace that zip code with just the city you could still identify 53% of the US population (Irani, Webb, Li, & Pu, 2011). This is an issue because users tend to have accounts on multiple different social media websites, each with different attributes listed. This would lead to the user becoming more susceptible to various attacks, e.g. password recovery attacks or phishing, by collecting the attributes from the multiple accounts of the same user. Gross & Acquisti (2005) stated that facebook users often put out sensitive information about themselves, most notably the user's name. 87.8% of users reveal their date of birth, 39.9% contain a phone number, 50.6% show their current place of residence, 62.8% show their relationship status, sometimes even identifying their partner; this could lead to more contextualised phishing. Users who disclose more personal information on their social media tend to be looking for the social benefits of it in the form of new relationships (Krasnova, Spiekermann, Koroleva, & Hildebrand, 2010), those who give away the most information are males, who disclose their numbers at a higher rate than female users (47.1% and 28.9% respectively) (Gross & Acquisti, 2005). This is a credible sources as it have been cited by 2818 this shows that this paper has been useful to a large group of academics in writing their paper</p>
                <p>Research has shown that phishing is changing to become more content aware, meaning that the attackers mine for data on various social media before engaging. It was found that participants did not understand the ramifications of the information they had publicly available. Due to this lack of knowledges there is a requirement for more extensive educational campaigns to teach the public about security threats (Jagatic, Johnson, Jakobsson, & Menczer, 2007).</p>
                <p>Li, Li, Yan, & Deng, (2015) stated that even if users do change privacy settings to mitigate the exposure of their personal information, it is still possible to find out attributes such as who the user is, who they know and what they do. The attacker can still find information by looking at other user’s profiles, such as if the individual has been tagged in any posts by friends. These exploits are caused by irregularities between the user wanting privacy and the business values of the social network in question. Lam, Chen, & Chen (2008) advises that there should be options that allow the user to prevent the user's friend from posting something that would then appear on or link to the said user's profile.</p>
                <h2 class="sub-heading">The Cloud</h2>
                <p>Security and privacy when using cloud computing are important as such services are currently in use for e-commerce applications, medical records, and office business applications; this require a guarantee that the information stay confidential.(Ristenpart, Tromer, Shacham, & Savage, 2009). To prevent this Squicciarini, Sundareswaran, & Lin (2010) recommend a three-tier data protection framework that has three different protection strategies being strong, medium and low protection. Strong protection means the service provider can’t look at the sensitive information, thus protecting against indexing . Medium protection stops the service provider from indexing effectively by disabling random access, this means that even if an index is built, it will no longer be effective. Low protection allows the use of the users data in indexing.</p>
                <p>There are many security issues surrounding cloud computing, the loss of physical security being one. It means users have zero knowledge and control of where their data and resources is stored. Access to the encryption and decryption keys should ideally only be available to the users themselves, not anyone else including employees of the company. Pearson (2009) states that the main privacy risk for cloud service users is being tracked and having their personal information given away without their knowledge; the user should be given a choice on whether they consent to their data being collected. In order to mitigate such risks, providers should change their placement policy for the purpose of making it more difficult for the attacker to be placed on the same physical machine as the potential victim. Companies should also prevent side-channel attacks by using various techniques such as cache wiping, random delay insertions etc (Ristenpart et al, 2009).</p>
                <p>According to Popović & Hocenski (2010), As the customers have lost control of physical security, it is in the company's best interest to ensure that physically, their sites are secured in order to avoid bad press and public outcry. The sites should have around the clock security with biometric hand readers with cameras to ensure Student Number: 895059 no physical breach is possible. Another way to reduce the risk is to train staff to ensure they have awareness to issues, as not doing so can allow the company to be exposed via social engineering attacks, the slower the response rate to security incidents.This course should contain security and risk management skills to the security team and internal partners.</p>
                <h2 class="sub-heading">Conclusion</h2>
                <p>In conclusion, there are various techniques users can use to mitigate their personal data exposure on the web from attackers that would have malicious intent. With social media, the biggest threat is the knowledge of how those bad actors may get at the user's information and what they can do with it. With cloud computing, the burden is more on the provider, if personal information leaks it would not only harm the user but the provider's reputation. It is important to keep in mind that even when using these mitigating actions, attackers will always evolve to meet the new standard and somehow find other techniques to steal to user’s personal information.</p>
